# Predictive-CRS

This is an extension to the CRS (Course Management System)

The student can tell about their previous courses and get an idea about how likely they're to succeed in some future course.

Regression is used for this feature. In the models.ipynb file, there are results for different models (linear, polynomial degrees)
